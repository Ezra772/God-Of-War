Armed with the Leviathan Axe—a weapon forged by the dwarves Brok and Sindri—and haunted by the memories of his past, Kratos must not only protect his son but also teach him to survive in a harsh world where every decision has consequences.

Atreus, now a teenager grappling with his identity as Loki, seeks answers about his role in the coming apocalypse. Together, they embark on a desperate journey across all Nine Realms: from the frozen lakes of Midgard to the golden halls of Asgard.

But the god of war, seeking to sever Kratos' last mortal ties, tricks him into killing his own wife and daughter. Covered in their ashes, which permanently bleach his skin white, Kratos becomes the Ghost of Sparta—haunted by nightmares of his deed.

            The Oracle of Athens tells Kratos he can be forgiven if he serves the other gods. After ten years of service, Athena offers him a final task: kill Ares, who has laid siege to Athens. To defeat a god, Kratos must find Pandora's Box, hidden in the Temple of Pandora within the Desert of Lost Souls.

            Along the way, he encounters old enemies like the barbarian king, new allies like the Titan Thera, and learns shocking truths about his past.

Kratos learns that Pandora holds the key to defeating Zeus, but using her requires another sacrifice.
